<h3>A new daily habit takes a month to cement</h3>

So you want to start a new habit?
The easiest way is to use a trigger, and start small.
A trigger should be something you do every day, like: get out of bed, brush your teeth, use the bathroom or brew tea or coffee.
Teach yourself to do the new thing when you hit the trigger.
Every time you are about to brush your teeth, do one push up first, just one, to get into the habit.
Don't worry about the effect.
The first thing to do is to actually do you thing.
Once the habit is in place, after a month, then you can increase your ambitions.</br>
</br>
I got my daughter to practice there Clarinet a couple of minutes every evening while I brush my teeth.
Now it is something we both look forward to, and never forget.

Whenever I have a moment or two to spare, I go through my flash cards in AnkiDroid.
I now do all of them, daily.
In reality I go through 15-30 per day.</br>

<h3>Flashcards will help you remember the details</h3>
<h3>Avoid distractions and task switching</h3>
<h3>Sleep</h3>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<h3>Eat between meals</h3>
<h3>Keep a list</h3>
<h3>Collaborate</h3>
<h3>Your actions are inferred. Your reasons are an afterthought.</h3>
