<h3>You need a technical guide</h3>
<h3>You need to practice</h3>
<h3>Learn a few things at a time</h3>

<h3>A new daily habit takes a month to cement</h3>

So you want to start a new habit?
The easiest way is to use a trigger, and start small.
A trigger should be something you do every day, like: get out of bed, brush your teeth, use the bathroom or brew tea or coffee.
Teach yourself to do the new thing when you hit the trigger.
Every time you are about to brush your teeth, do one push up first, just one, to get into the habit.
Don't worry about the effect.
The first thing to do is to actually do you thing.
Once the habit is in place, after a month, then you can increase your ambitions.
</br>
</br>
I got my daughter to practice there Clarinet a couple of minutes every evening while I brush my teeth.
Now it is something we both look forward to, and never forget.
</br>
</br>
Whenever I have a moment or two to spare, I go through my flash cards in AnkiDroid.
I now do all of them, daily.
In reality I go through 15-30 per day.
</br>
</br>

<h3>Flashcards will help you remember the details</h3>

There are so many things to remember.
A friend of mine was studying to become a physician.
They have to learn all the Latin names of all there bones in three body, by heart.
And the organs.
And the nerves, the glands and everything else.
How do they do it?
Flash cards help a lot.
AnkiDroid automates this.
AnkiDroid is an app for Android.
I'm sure there is an equivalent for other phones.
</br>
</br>
My advice is to start small and make it personal.
Everyone is different.
I would keep at least two decks of cards:
One for your domain or customer
One for your technology
</br>
</br>
Whenever you encounter a concept that you think it would be beneficial to know by heart, add it to the appropriate deck.
Don't be afraid to add more decks. It makes it easier to drop one group of cards should you lose that customer, or switch technology stack.
Don't add too many cards, or out will be overwhelming.
Remove cards that newcomer obsolete.
</br>
</br>
Cards can relate to concepts, products, people, places.
Anything that would maker you look smarter if you knew it by heart.
</br>
</br>
Basically the main reason anyone does anything is to get laid.
Let me explain.
Every feature you add to your software solution said help your users get laid.
Either by getting home earlier, making more money, or impressing people in other ways.
This will help you get laid.
</br>
</br>
Back to AnkiDroid.
I would stay away from the complete decks available for download.
I think you will be overwhelmed.
It is better to start small.
