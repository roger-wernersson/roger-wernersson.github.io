<h3>You need a technical guide</h3>

How do you know what to focus your improvements on?
Reasoning done in groups is way more clever than reasoning done individuality, so talk to someone who knows the subject area.
Professional athletes have professional coaches; soccer players, tennis players, dancers.
They can tell what needs polish, partly because they have an outside view partly because the are experts in the subject area.
As you, most likely, work in a team, you could really use someone with a view on the whole team.
Team members can complement each others' weaknesses.
Your coach can be someone in the team.
A good guide can see the weak stops of the team, and make sure the team develop the skills needed to make those spots stronger.

<h3>You need to practice</h3>

Effective improvement is the result of deliberate practice.
You will become good at what you do, be it taking the stairs or the lift.
So once you know what you want to improve, make sure to set aside time to practice this.
</br>
</br>
Musicians practice scales, to learn the ins and outs of their instruments.
So should we.
Software development is perfect for this.
There cost of starting over on an exercise is usually zero; make a clean clone, or restore to three previous state.
The concept of coding dojos is powerful.
In a dojo you can sharpen many of your skills in several ways, be it the TDD cycle, keyboard shortcuts, event storming, refactoring, pair programming, or something completely different.
Practicing with a guide will make you progress towards your goal faster and more efficiently.

<h3>Learn a few things at a time</h3>

You have a large set of skills that you already master.
You probably have a large set of skills you wish you did master.
In between those two, keep a small set of skills you are currently improving.
If you are too ambitious in this area, and the pool of improvements is too big, you will get nowhere.
It is an inherent limitation that you just have to comply with.
</br>
</br>
<pre>
┌────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────┐
│  Pool  │      │   Ongoing   │      │  Pool   │
│   of   ├──────┤ Improvement ├──────┤   of    │
│ Wishes │      └─────────────┘      │ Mastery │
└────────┘                           └─────────┘
</pre>
</br>
</br>
Therefore it makes sense to plan your improvements.
What is most important?
What would make the biggest impact first?
You might want to get outside help on this; a guide.
</br>
</br>
Remember that you, most likely, work in a team.
You don’t have to be an expert on everything.
Your team-mates can cover your weak spots.
And you can cover theirs.
</br>
</br>
Also remember to practice the skills you want to perfect.
You get good at what you do, so be sure to do what you want to improve.
There is no shortcut.

<h3>A new daily habit takes a month to cement</h3>

So you want to start a new habit?
The easiest way is to use a trigger, and start small.
A trigger should be something you do every day, like: get out of bed, brush your teeth, use the bathroom or brew tea or coffee.
Teach yourself to do the new thing when you hit the trigger.
Every time you are about to brush your teeth, do one push up first, just one, to get into the habit.
Don't worry about the effect.
The first thing to do is to actually do you thing.
Once the habit is in place, after a month, then you can increase your ambitions.
</br>
</br>
I got my daughter to practice there Clarinet a couple of minutes every evening while I brush my teeth.
Now it is something we both look forward to, and never forget.
</br>
</br>
Whenever I have a moment or two to spare, I go through my flash cards in AnkiDroid.
I now do all of them, daily.
In reality I go through 15-30 per day.
</br>
</br>

<h3>Flashcards will help you remember the details</h3>

There are so many things to remember.
A friend of mine was studying to become a physician.
They have to learn all the Latin names of all there bones in three body, by heart.
And the organs.
And the nerves, the glands and everything else.
How do they do it?
Flash cards help a lot.
AnkiDroid automates this.
AnkiDroid is an app for Android.
I'm sure there is an equivalent for other phones.
</br>
</br>
My advice is to start small and make it personal.
Everyone is different.
I would keep at least two decks of cards:
One for your domain or customer
One for your technology
</br>
</br>
Whenever you encounter a concept that you think it would be beneficial to know by heart, add it to the appropriate deck.
Don't be afraid to add more decks. It makes it easier to drop one group of cards should you lose that customer, or switch technology stack.
Don't add too many cards, or out will be overwhelming.
Remove cards that newcomer obsolete.
</br>
</br>
Cards can relate to concepts, products, people, places.
Anything that would maker you look smarter if you knew it by heart.
</br>
</br>
Basically the main reason anyone does anything is to get laid.
Let me explain.
Every feature you add to your software solution said help your users get laid.
Either by getting home earlier, making more money, or impressing people in other ways.
This will help you get laid.
</br>
</br>
Back to AnkiDroid.
I would stay away from the complete decks available for download.
I think you will be overwhelmed.
It is better to start small.
</br>
</br>

<h3>Avoid distractions and task switching</h3>

As a developer, a lot of problems you solve are non-trivial.
It takes time and effort to build a mental model of the problem context in your mind.
Any distraction or interruption while holding this mental model runs a high risk or bursting the bubble, setting you back to square one.
This is part of the reason task-switching is counter-productive.
Dropping one complex mental model, and replacing it with another takes time and effort.
Set setup time is considerable.
</br>
</br>
You need to minimize the risk of distractions and interruptions.
Turn off all but the most vital notifications on your mobile devices, and use the Do Not Disturb mode.
Your ICE contacts can still call you.
The mere precense of a mobile device you the room can reduce your ability to focus, and drain your willpower.
</br>
</br>
Close all but the most vital pages in your browsers.
In slack, mute the channels you don’t have to be aware of while solving problems.
You can always catch up later.
It is better to set aside time for reading email in the afternoon.
You have more focus and energy in the morning.
</br>
</br>
Your brain has evolved to be very aware of your surroundings, constantly on the outlook for threats and opportunities.
This kept your ancestors alive.
These days it stops you focusing on the problem at hand.
You are not good at multitasking.
Very few people are.

<h3>Sleep</h3>

Lack of sleep can cause many problems for you.
It reduces your immune system.
It increases risk for mental illness such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkison’s disease.
It reduces your capacity for focus, willpower and self control.
</br>
</br>
There are several ways of increasing your chances of you getting enough sleep.
Exercise will make your body tired and you will fall asleep quicker.
Avoid exercise right before bedtime.
</br>
</br>
Alcohol will make you fall asleep quicker, but also makes your sleep less good.
You should avoid alcohol before going to bed if you care about your sleep quality.
</br>
</br>
Remove all screens from your bedroom.
The light and the sounds mobile devices make disturbs your sleep.
The mere presence of a mobile device can make you sleep quality drop.
Turn down all light around you a couple of hours before bedtime.

<h3>Collaborate</h3>

People working in groups can solve more complex problems and make fewer mistakes.
It is better to present a rough idea, than to polish it until it shines, because your peers are more likely to spot weaknesses in your ideas than your are, just as you are more likely to spot weaknesses in theirs than they are.
Work as a team .
Complement each others' weaknesses.
</br>
</br>
When working in a team, aim for psychological safety.
Grow a culture in which it is ok to fail, and learn from mistakes.
People do what you do, not what you say.
Culture is read only.
You need to work on behaviour.
You can address the goals, the resources, the constraints and the actors, which together drive behaviour.
Avoid carrots and sticks.
Aim to improve the intrincis motivation.
</br>
</br>
Keep high performing teams working together 
It takes time to build a good team.
Don't waste it by shuffling people around, treating them as interchangeable parts.
</br>
</br>
Pair programming is a great way of getting immediate code review, and to keep focus and avoid distractions.
It takes practice to get good at it.
You might even want to try mob programming.
It is also a good way of spreading domain knowledge and best practices for both tools and processes.
