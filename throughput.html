<h3>You need a technical guide</h3>

How do you know what to focus your improvements on?
Reasoning done in groups is way more clever than reasoning done individuality, so talk to someone who knows the subject area.
Professional athletes have professional coaches; soccer players, tennis players, dancers.
They can tell what needs polish, partly because they have an outside view partly because the are experts in the subject area.
As you, most likely, work in a team, you could really use someone with a view on the whole team.
Team members can complement each others' weaknesses.
Your coach can be someone in the team.
A good guide can see the weak spots of the team, and make sure the team develop the skills needed to make those spots stronger.

<h3>You need to practice</h3>

Effective improvement is the result of deliberate practice.
You will become good at what you do, be it taking the stairs or the lift.
So once you know what you want to improve, make sure to set aside time to practice this.
</br>
</br>
Musicians practice scales, to learn the ins and outs of their instruments.
So should we.
Software development is perfect for this.
There cost of starting over on an exercise is usually zero; make a clean clone, or restore to three previous state.
The concept of coding dojos is powerful.
In a dojo you can sharpen many of your skills in several ways, be it the TDD cycle, keyboard shortcuts, event storming, refactoring, pair programming, or something completely different.
Practicing with a guide will make you progress towards your goal faster and more efficiently.

<h3>Learn a few things at a time</h3>

You have a large set of skills that you already master.
You probably have a large set of skills you wish you did master.
In between those two, keep a small set of skills you are currently improving.
If you are too ambitious in this area, and the pool of improvements is too big, you will get nowhere.
It is an inherent limitation that you just have to comply with.
</br>
</br>
<pre>
┌────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────┐
│  Pool  │      │   Ongoing   │      │  Pool   │
│   of   ├──────┤ Improvement ├──────┤   of    │
│ Wishes │      └─────────────┘      │ Mastery │
└────────┘                           └─────────┘
</pre>
</br>
</br>
Therefore it makes sense to plan your improvements.
What is most important?
What would make the biggest impact first?
You might want to get outside help on this; a guide.
</br>
</br>
Remember that you, most likely, work in a team.
You don’t have to be an expert on everything.
Your team-mates can cover your weak spots.
And you can cover theirs.
</br>
</br>
Also remember to practice the skills you want to perfect.
You get good at what you do, so be sure to do what you want to improve.
There is no shortcut.

<h3>A new daily habit takes time to cement</h3>

So you want to start a new habit?
The easiest way is to use a trigger, and start small.
A trigger should be something you do every day, like: get out of bed, brush your teeth, use the bathroom or brew tea or coffee.
Teach yourself to do the new thing when you hit the trigger.
Every time you are about to brush your teeth, do one push up first, just one, to get into the habit.
Don't worry about the effect.
The first thing to do is to actually do you thing.
Once the habit is in place, after a month, then you can increase your ambitions.
</br>
</br>
I got my daughter to practice there Clarinet a couple of minutes every evening while I brush my teeth.
Now it is something we both look forward to, and never forget.
</br>
</br>
Whenever I have a moment or two to spare, I go through my flash cards in AnkiDroid.
I now do all of them, daily.
In reality I go through 15-30 per day.
</br>
</br>

<h3>Flashcards will help you remember the details</h3>

There are so many things to remember.
A friend of mine was studying to become a physician.
They have to learn all the Latin names of all there bones in the body, by heart.
And the organs.
And the nerves, the glands and everything else.
How do they do it?
Flash cards help a lot.
AnkiDroid automates this.
AnkiDroid is an app for Android.
There are several equivalents for other mobile platforms.
</br>
</br>
My advice is to start small and make it personal.
Everyone is different.
I would keep at least two decks of cards:
<ul>
<li>One for your domain or customer
<li>One for your technology
</ul>
</br>
</br>
Whenever you encounter a concept that you think it would be beneficial to know by heart, add it to the appropriate deck.
Don't be afraid to add more decks. It makes it easier to drop one group of cards should you lose that customer, or switch technology stack.
Don't add too many cards, or out will be overwhelming.
Remove cards that becomes obsolete.
</br>
</br>
Cards can relate to concepts, products, people, places.
Anything that would maker you look smarter if you knew it by heart.
</br>
</br>
Basically the main reason anyone does anything is to get laid.
Let me explain.
Every feature you add to your software solution said help your users get laid.
Either by getting home earlier, making more money, or impressing people in other ways.
This will help you get laid.
</br>
</br>
Back to AnkiDroid.
I would stay away from the complete decks available for download.
I think you will be overwhelmed.
It is better to start small.
</br>
</br>

<h3>Avoid distractions and task switching</h3>

As a developer, a lot of problems you solve are non-trivial.
It takes time and effort to build a mental model of the problem context in your mind.
Any distraction or interruption while holding this mental model runs a high risk or bursting the bubble, setting you back to square one.
This is part of the reason task-switching is counter-productive.
Dropping one complex mental model, and replacing it with another takes time and effort.
Set setup time is considerable.
</br>
</br>
You need to minimize the risk of distractions and interruptions.
Turn off all but the most vital notifications on your mobile devices, and use the Do Not Disturb mode.
Your ICE contacts can still call you.
The mere precense of a mobile device you the room can reduce your ability to focus, and drain your willpower.
</br>
</br>
Close all but the most vital pages in your browsers.
In slack, mute the channels you don’t have to be aware of while solving problems.
You can always catch up later.
It is better to set aside time for reading email in the afternoon.
You have more focus and energy in the morning.
</br>
</br>
Your brain has evolved to be very aware of your surroundings, constantly on the outlook for threats and opportunities.
This kept your ancestors alive.
These days it stops you focusing on the problem at hand.
You are not good at multitasking.
Very few people are.

<h3>Sleep</h3>

Lack of sleep can cause many problems for you.
It reduces your immune system.
It increases risk for mental illness such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkison’s disease.
It reduces your capacity for focus, willpower and executive control.
</br>
</br>
There are several ways of increasing your chances of you getting enough sleep.
Exercise will make your body tired and you will fall asleep quicker.
Avoid exercise right before bedtime.
</br>
</br>
Alcohol will make you fall asleep quicker, but also makes your sleep less good.
You should avoid alcohol before going to bed if you care about your sleep quality.
</br>
</br>
Remove all screens from your bedroom.
The light and the sounds mobile devices make disturbs your sleep.
The mere presence of a mobile device can make you sleep quality drop.
Turn down all light around you a couple of hours before bedtime.

<h3>Collaborate</h3>

People working in groups can solve more complex problems and make fewer mistakes.
It is better to present a rough idea, than to polish it until it shines, because your peers are more likely to spot weaknesses in your ideas than your are, just as you are more likely to spot weaknesses in theirs than they are.
Work as a team .
Complement each others' weaknesses.
</br>
</br>
When working in a team, aim for psychological safety.
Grow a culture in which it is ok to fail, and learn from mistakes.
People do what you do, not what you say.
Culture is read only.
You need to work on behaviour.
You can address the goals, the resources, the constraints and the actors, which together drive behaviour.
Avoid carrots and sticks.
Aim to improve the intrinsic motivation.
</br>
</br>
Keep high performing teams working together 
It takes time to build a good team.
Don't waste it by shuffling people around, treating them as interchangeable parts.
</br>
</br>
Pair programming is a great way of getting immediate code review, and to keep focus and avoid distractions.
It takes practice to get good at it.
You might even want to try mob programming.
It is also a good way of spreading domain knowledge and best practices for both tools and processes.

<h3>Your actions are intuitive responses. Your reasons are an afterthought.</h3>

You are stupid.
Or rather, your actions are not always clever.
The fact is, your actions are all based on intuitive responses.
The reasoning you do to explain your actions are all constructed after your intuitive response.
Even if your decision is to not act, that decision is also intuitive.
You might explain it afterwards, but those reasons are constructed after the fact.
That is how the brain works.
</br>
</br>
We are social creatures.
We reason because we need to align the group's behaviour to use the strength in numbers, either by changing the behaviour of others, or by seeing the fault in ours an adopting their behaviour.
Either way, the group grows stronger.
You can change someone's behaviour by motivating them to change using sticks, carrots, or reasoning, the latter being the only one able to scale big.
The recipient of your reasoning is more adept at scrutinizing the reasons than you were when you constructed them.
That is how the brain works.
It protects is from adopting stupid behaviour just because someone told us.
If you want to be clever, you have to bounce your ideas off of other people.
Alone is stupid.
The same goes for when someone wants to change your behaviour.
You will be very good at finding faults in the chain of logic used.
</br>
</br>
To change your own behaviour, you need to change your intuitions.
This becomes especially important for what you do when you are stressed.
This is when you fall back on your habits.
So if you know what you need to do when the going gets tough, you need to practice this over and over until it becomes second nature.
Practice makes perfect.
</br>
</br>
This makes me wonder.
Does this apply to AI?
Their reasoning is also intuitive.
They can't explain how they arrived at their solutions, just like we can't.
What we can do is construct reasons to support our intuitions, and try to convince others of their superiority.
Maybe is should be part of the AI field of research; make the AI explain their intuitions.
Is this what consciousness is; the reasoning engine in the brain observing what the test of the brain is up to and making up excuses to make us socially acceptable?

<h3>Decisions and routines</h3>

It is like you wake up every morning with a mug full of decision tokens.
Every time you have to make a decision, you spend another token.
When you run out of tokens, you start to make less good decisions.
This is why you eat cake or candy in the evening.
You have no more tokens.
</br>
</br>
So what you should do is you rely more of routine.
You can reduce the number of decisions you spend on travel, food, clothes.
If you always obey the speed limits when you drive, you don't have to decide when to drive faster, or how fast to go.
You save tokens.
If you always take the shirt to the left in the rack, the trousers at the top of the stack, and all your socks look the same, you don't have to decide what to wear.
Save those tokens for when it matters.
Of course, for some people, what you wear is more important, by you can find other areas to automate.
Save those tokens!
</br>
</br>
Not acting of also a decision.
Every time your phone pings, not looking at it costs a decision token.
If you do pick it up, you task switch and lose momentum in whatever you were doing before.
</br>
</br>
Turn off notification on your screens as much as possible.
Set aside time for less urgent interruptions before and after chunks of productive work.
For some, even having a phone in your pocket is a distraction.

<h3>Keep a list</h3>

Humans can’t fly big aircrafts.
It is too complex.
Aircraft manufacturers include folders full of checklists for pilots to use for every non-trivial eventuality; starting, landing, losing an engine, losing a door.
</br>
</br>
Physicians in theatre also face very complex problems.
Hospital theaters also use checklists to make sure everybody knows everybody’s names, that there is extra blood for the patient, that everybody washed their hands, etc.
</br>
</br>
Many things we do as software developers are complex.
Automate what you can.
For most other situations, use a checklist.
Add items that will improve communication among team members.
Involve all members of the team in the checklist creation process.
You might think that you won’t forget to run all tests locally before submitting, but you will, occasionally.
Remember to plan the demo of a task before writing the first failing test case, which in turn comes before modifying production code.
Going through all steps of a task, from start to finish, is easy to forget one.
</br>
</br>
Writing checklists is a skill.
There are people who work full time with this.
Here are a few guidelines.
Utilize natural breaks in the flow.
Use simple sentence structure and basic language.
Set a title that reflects its objectives.
Have a simple, uncluttered, and logical format.
Make it fit on one page.
Minimize the use of color.
Marked clearly with the date of creation (or revision)
</br>
</br>
Remember to try the checklist with front line users (either in a real or simulated situation).
Modify the checklist in response to repeated trials.
</br>
</br>
My checklist for starting task can look like this:
<ul>
<li>Claim issue and put in progress
<li>Check time estimate
<li>Find missing information
<li>Plan demo
<li>Watch all tests go green
<li>Create pull-request-branch
<li>Refactor
<li>Write test
</ul>
</br>
</br>
My checklist for ending task can look like this:
<ul>
<li>Refactor
<li>Run all tests locally
<li>Try out manually
<li>Update documentation (optional)
<li>Add logging (optional)
<li>Add translation (optional)
<li>Invite for review
<li>Run the demo for myself
<li>Add to list of tasks to demo
<li>Add note on task of which build it is included in
</ul>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

After you have finished growing up, your brain starts to shrink.
You lose about 0.5-1% per year.
Don’t despair.
There is a cure.
Exercise.
</br>
</br>
Physical exercise, where you increase your heart-rate to at least 70% of your max pulse, makes your brain regrow, rejuvenating it, regaining what you might lose from aging.
It will improve your memory, pattern recognition, sense of direction, concentration, creativity, IQ, ability to read and understand, executive control.
It is also helps against depression, aging in general, stress, epilepsy, dementia.
You get the optimal benefit when you want to learn something new if you exercise just before, or during studying.
</br>
</br>
Working out is also good, but only helps with stress and the ability for associations.
</br>
</br>
Remember that even if you exercise, sitting still for too long is as dangerous as smoking cigarettes.
</br>
</br>
Some effects will wear off after a few hours.
</br>
</br>
Some effects don’t appear until after six weeks.
Brushing your teeth once does not help.
You have to brush them twice, every day, for the rest of your life.
Only then will the effects kick in.
</br>
</br>
Also, your brain performs better when you are standing up.

<h3>Eat between meals</h3>

You need a snack.
Not because you deserve it, but because you perform worse on an empty stomach.
Hard tasks will feel harder just before lunch.
Have a fruit.
Kudos to employers that provide fruit to their employees.
Feel free to bring your own if you are not so lucky.

<h3>Punished by Reqards.</h3>

Incentives kill creativity.
Sticks don't work.
You will only grow a culture of blame and scapegoats.
Carrots don't work.
People who get rewarded for creativity tends to make safer bets in the future, in effect becoming less creative and taking fewer risks.
Don't even praise.
People become addicted to praise.
</br>
</br>
Instead, foster intrinsic motivation.
Make people do their best because they want to.
Feel free to acknowledge effort.

<h3>Keep a journal</h3>

Task switching kills productivity.
Juggling as few as three tasks can make progress grind to a halt.
One way to alleviate the cost is to keep a journal.
Whenever you switch away from a task, you write a few lines in your journal about what you were doing.
Then as you start on the next task, you can start with the time, and then write a few lines about what you are supposed to do.
</br>
</br>
You can keep one journal per project, and maybe even a master journal just writing about the big picture.
It can also help you keep track of how much time you spend on tasks.
</br>
</br>
Additionally, write findings and useful commands or small scripts.
Add keywords that allows you to easily find these entries in the future.
</br>
</br>
You can also benefit from adding links to other documents in the journal.
This allows you to quickly find relevant information.
You can add links to tasks in your task tool, or Pull Requests in you Git tool.
Links to Architecture Documentation and test, staging and production environments is also useful.
At the top of the Journal, keep a list to documents such as these, that keep being relevant.
</br>
</br>
Another thing you can do, especially if you keep one journal per project or task, is to keep a TODO-list at the bottom.
Add normal journal entries immediately above the TODO-list.
</br>
</br>
If you access these journals on you phone, it will become difficult to go to the end of the journal where the latest entries are.
Add a bookmark as the last entry in the document.
Then add a shortcut available at the top that takes you to this bookmark.

<h3>Ugly and Distrubing</h3>

You will remember a text better if it written in a font that is hard to read,
or if you study in an environment in which it is a bit difficult to concentrate.
If you have to work harder, it will stick better.
