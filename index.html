<h1>Improve</h1>

Improve or be obsolete.</br>
</br>
A small improvement every day accumulates to great improvements over time, like accumulating interest on an investment.
As long as you keep improving, the results will add up.</br>
</br>
Instead of leveling up in Pokemon or learning everything about a football team, how about leveling up in real life?
Every design pattern you learn is another level-up. Enjoy!</br>

<h1>Control</h1>
Improvement should be guided and requires deliberate practice.
Your guide should be someone in your line of business to be able to point out skills you need to improve.
You are not an island.
Your guide should take your team into consideration.
Not everyone have to be brilliant at everything.</br>
