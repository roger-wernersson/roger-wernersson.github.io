<h1>Improve</h1>

Improve or be obsolete.</br>

A small improvement every day accumulates to great improvements over time, like accumulating interest on an investment.
As long as you keep improving, the results will add up.</br>

Viewed as a machine it might look like this</br>

<h1>Control</h1>
Improvement should be guided and requires deliberate practice.
Your guide should be someone in your line of business to be able to point out skills you need to improve.</br>
You are not an island.
Your guide should take your team into consideration.
Not everyone have to be brilliant at everything.
