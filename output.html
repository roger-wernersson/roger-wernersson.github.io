<h1>Output</h1>

The output should be software which is easy to develop, maintain, deploy and operate, and which matches relevant use cases.

<h2>Quantity</h2>

To be really productive when developing software, the code base needs to be agile and clean, unless it is small and you know it well.

Keeping the code agile while actively developing it requires refactoring.
Make the code look like it was written to do what it does from the beginning.
Keep the code clean and aligned with the language of the relevant context.

To be able to refactor the code, you will need tests.
The best way to put the code under tests is if you write the test before you implement the functionality.
