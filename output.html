<h1>Output</h1>

The output should be software which is easy to develop, maintain, deploy and operate, and which matches relevant use cases.</br>

To be really productive when developing software, the code base needs to be agile and clean, unless it is small and you know it well.</br>
</br>
Keeping the code agile while actively developing it requires refactoring.
Make the code look like it was written to do what it does from the beginning.
Keep the code clean and aligned with the language of the relevant context.</br>
</br>
To be able to refactor the code, you will need tests.
The best way to put the code under tests is if you write the test before you implement the functionality.</br>
</br>
Test driven development is based on a tight feedback-loop in four steps.
You should strive to never be more than a few minutes from green tests.</br>
</br>
The first step it to write a failing test case for the functionality you will implement next.
You can consider code that does not compile to be a failing test case.</br>
</br>
Once the code compiles, the second step is to make the error message tell the reader what is wrong in a clear and obvious way.
You will need this for when you break this test in the future.</br>
</br>
The third step is to write the simplest implementation that will make the test pass.
If you are not happy with the implementation, add more tests to force the implementation to become more generic.
See Transform Priority Premise for how the implementation can evovle from specific to generic.</br>

<h3>Test driven development</h3>
The Chicago School focuses on bottom-up testing.
Start by building small units with which to build larger units unti the functionality is in place.</br>
</br>
The London School starts with high-level tests and hard-coding the implementation.
Then the developers refactors the solution and pushes the hard-coding further down into the details of the code.
When a supporting unit is created it is tested and made more general after adding tests for it.</br>
</br>
There are several coding katas which can help you practice and improve TDD skills.
A good place to start is the String Calculator kata.</br>
